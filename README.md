# experiment-docker-datacenter
a series of experiments to create a mockup of a entire companies datacenter; 
slow and steady learning through trial and error, documenting the resources references in the various folders
:)    

The interesting file is the text file labelled docker-dc-MMDDYYletter.txt   
That documents the commands and the specifics of each experiment.  Important to start there.

I will try to keep that as up to date as I can.
